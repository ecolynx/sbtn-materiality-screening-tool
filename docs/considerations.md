## Evaluation

The range of threshold values reflects the distribution of **pressure scores** within each **pressure category**. Users must interpret these scores indepentently for each pressure and not compare across **pressure cagegories**. As can be seen in the [full materiality dataset](full-materiality-dataset.md), the contributions of economic activities towards some environmental pressures are much better documented than others and the interpretation of impacts for different pressures may also be categorized differently.

## Limitations

Scores and ratings reflect typical impacts at sector level, and may not be specific enough to capture the reality of every company.

!!! note "SBTN"
    This is why **Step 1a** is followed directly by **Step 1b**, in which companies introduce their own data to refine the materiality assessment.

!!! warning "Development"
    The **materiality ratings** represent potential impacts and not actual impacts. Development work around the ratings is ongoing, in particular to explore and implement improvements to upstream and downstream links using input-output modelling.

## Alternative

Companies may also complete their screening at the [`ISIC group`](definitions.md#isic-group) level using the [full materiality dataset](full-materiality-dataset.md). In this approach, scoring is based on an average of the relevant `production processes` associated with the [`ISIC group`](definitions.md#isic-group) (**average materiality**). 

!!! warning "Important"
    For companies using this approach, if an economic activitiy at the [`ISIC group`](definitions.md#isic-group) level is not considered material, they must still include `production processes` within that group which are likely material for that pressure unless they can prove that the `production process` is not relevant to their operations. 

<!-- This approach is offered to allow for flexibility in the assessment process and the ability to complete the screening more quickly. It is not intended to contradict the evaluation of an individual production process. The interface for anlaysis at this level (similar to tabs 4 and 5) may be created in further revisions of the tool. -->
