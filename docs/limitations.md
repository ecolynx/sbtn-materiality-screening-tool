Scores and ratings reflect typical impacts at sector level, and may not be specific enough to capture the reality of every company.

!!! note "SBTN"
    This is why **Step 1a** is followed directly by **Step 1b**, in which companies introduce their own data to refine the materiality assessment.

!!! warning "Development"
    The **materiality ratings** represent potential impacts and not actual impacts. Development work around the ratings is ongoing, in particular to explore and implement improvements to upstream and downstream links using input-output modelling.
