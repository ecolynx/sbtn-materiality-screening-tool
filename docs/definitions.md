## `ISIC group`

:   ISIC is the United Nationsâ€™ international reference classification of productive activities. ISIC is subdivided in a hierarchical, four-level structure. The categories at the highest level are called sections (e.g. Manufacturing), followed by divisions (e.g. Manufacture of Textiles) and groups (e.g. Manufacture of Other Textiles). Further detail on the economic activities included in each ISIC category can be found [here](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf).

## `production process`

:   The ENCORE dataset developed by UNEP-WCMC uses a unique economic activity categorization called `production process`.

## `group-process`

:   Because this tool builds from the ENCORE dataset developed by UNEP-WCMC, which uses a unique economic activity categorization called `production process`, all `production processes` have been linked to `ISIC group` categories in order to ascertain the materiality ratings shown in the [SBTN Materiality Screening Tool](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SBTN-Materiality-Screening-Tool-v1.xlsx). The linking of the `production process` to `ISIC group` categories, called concordance, was performed manually by UNEP-WCMC and SBTN teams and supported with background research on the economic activities.

## `activity-pressure`

:   A `group-process` and **pressure category** pair.
