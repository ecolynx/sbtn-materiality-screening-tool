# Overview

This documentation is based on the [SBTN Materiality Screening Tool](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SBTN-Materiality-Screening-Tool-v1.xlsx) (Version: `v1 May 2023`) developed by UNEP-WCMC, BCG and SBTN.

<!-- The aim is to help users carry out a first screening of the types of environmental impacts that are potentially materially relevant to their sector and their company's activities. -->

## Purpose

The [SBTN Materiality Screening Tool](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SBTN-Materiality-Screening-Tool-v1.xlsx) was developed for SBTN to facilitate an initial materiality screening that companies could use to determine which economic activities and pressures likely require science-based targets for nature.

!!! info "SBTN"
    The initial screening process corresponds to **Step 1a** of the SBTN guidance. During the subsequent steps of the SBTN method, companies are expected to refine their understanding of environmental and societal materiality and gather more precise and accurate information to quantify their environmental impacts.

<!-- !!! note
    This tool is currently in its 'beta' form. Functionalities, like the screening of  pressures in a company's upstream, are not currently available. Updates are expected in the near future. -->

## Value Chain Coverage

For this release of the documentation (Version: `v1 May 2023`), the tool functionality encompasses activities in companiesâ€™ direct operations and upstreams. Downstream activities will not be included in the current iteration of the tool. 

!!! note "Direct Operations"
    This version of the tool is for beta testing and only contains scores for direct operations. The upstream scores will be added in the near future.

## Features

-   :material-tools:{ .lg .middle } __Exploration Tool__

    Select [`ISIC groups`](definitions.md#isic-group) and explore their corresponding [`production processes'`](definitions.md#production-process) **materiality ratings** for each **pressure category**

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Tool](materiality-screening-tool.md)

    ---

-   :material-database:{ .lg .middle } __Full Dataset__

    Consult the full materiality dataset and explore the average **materiality ratings** for each **pressure category** at an [`ISIC group`](definitions.md#isic-group) level

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- -   :material-format-font:{ .lg .middle } __Other Classifications__

    If necessary, translate the materiality tool, currently in the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) into other classifications.

## Outline
This documentation comprises 9 pages:

1. ReadMe 1 - Overview: Preview of the content in this tool, context of development, how to use and interpret, and credits for development. 
2. ReadMe 2 - Interpretation guidance: a complete overview of the content of the tool, including guidance on primary requirements and recommendations for use of the tool in Step 1a.
3. ReadMe 2  -  Methodology: a summary of the methodology used to prepare the materiality tool, including useful definitions and an explanation of how ratings were derived.
4. Materiality - Direct Operations: Provides 'pressure scores' and 'materiality ratings' for each economic activity, for each pressure. Using the slicer widget on the lefthand side of the sheet, users can select the economic activities they are interested in (described by ISIC Group or Production Process).
5. Summary by Activities: Summary sheet automatically populates according to inputs in the Materiality sheet. Companies can use this sheet to review the number of pressures that need to assessed, per activity, further in the value chain assessment. This sheet can also be used by companies as the output template for Step 1a. 
6. Materiality - Upstream: Under development. Once available, this sheet will automatically populate based on the activities selected in the direct operations sheet. Upstream sectors will be indentified based on known connections between economic activities reflected in economic trade data.
7. Full materiality dataset: Dataset derived by pairing the production processes from the ENCORE tool with ISIC group categories. 
8. Base data for materiality rule: This sheet includes just the 'production process' categories and the scores associated with these, which were used to calculate the materiality threshold for each pressure category. 
9.  ISIC Detail: Detail detail of the ISIC framework to help companies determine the appropriate classifications to use.
10. Crosswalk ISIC - NACE - GICS: Resource for companies familiar with alternative economic classifications; this table can be used to translate any ISIC class into its equivalent(s) in the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) or Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) classification. -->
