This documentation is a direct copy of the [SBTN Materiality Screening Tool](https://sciencebasedtargetsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SBTN-Materiality-Screening-Tool-v1.xlsx) developed by UNEP-WCMC, BCG and SBTN. The tool is designed to help companies identify the environmental impacts that are potentially material to their business, as part of Step 1a of the SBTN guidance.
