## Instructions

The default setting in this tool is to display all activities categorized within ISIC.* To browse in this mode, users can filter the tool alphabetically by clicking on the arrow filter button on the right of the column "ISIC Group (Alphabetical)". 

Alternatively, users can use the slicer widget below to select activities that are most revelent. To select the activities most relevant to you, please first clear the selection using the icon illustrated as a filter with a red "x" in the top-right corner of the slicer tool and then use the multi-select button to the left of this, shown with multiple rows and green check marks.

*The ISIC is subdivided in a hierarchical, four-level structure. The categories at the highest level are called sections followed by divisions, groups and finally classes, that consider only one activity. Please see sheet 'ISIC Standalone' if you need help determining which 'group' categories to select.
